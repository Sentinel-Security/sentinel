## Sentinel Discord Bot (Open-Sourced)
The Sentinel Discord Bot (Open-Sourced) is designed to help developers interested in creating their own global ban bots with the basic functions. We will not provide exact replicas of Sentinel, rather a skeleton of the bot and its core functions. 

## System Requirements
- Node.js v14 or Higher
- If creating an API as well, a NGINX Webserver and at least 1 open port are required

## Databases
Sentinel utilizes SQLite Databases with the [Keyv](https://github.com/lukechilds/keyv/) adapter.

## Assistance
If you need assistance with the code, feel free to visit our [Discord Server](https://sntl.cc/discord)
